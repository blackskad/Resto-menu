Webscraper and android application to display the daily menu of the resto's of @GhentUni

API
---

The scraper pull the menu from the UGent website and parses into a workable json format. The current API is located at http://zeus.ugent.be/~blackskad/resto/api/0.1/ The number at the end of the URL indicates the version of the API. Currently the API is at version 0.1

The api currently only supports the json format. If necessary, the scraper can be adapted to support other formats as well.

* ./list.json
A list of all UGent resto's. For each resto a struct with 4 values is provided: the `name`, `address`, `latitude` and `longitude`.

* ./week/[O-9]{2}.json
This resource contains the menu's for a whole week. The number in the URL is the number of the week. The list will at most contain 5 entries, one for each day of the week. Each of those entries contains 1 or 4 keys. If the `open` key is false, all resto's are closed that day and no other keys are provided. If `open` is true, the keys `meat`, `soup` and `vegetables` are also provided. An example structure is provided below. This is a typical structure with 4 meat entries, 1 soup entry and 2 vegetable entries.
